# App Development 
This document outlines a process for app development. [Developer Intro](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Se2NLPK-CjzccOZjRtfLzqrKG63QOgN1tAp35gWmZlU/edit?usp=sharing)

## Introduction
App development is at the heart of how we grow. Without apps, Shuffle as a product and solution is useless. Together with Workflows, Apps can solve any problems our customers, and users may be seeking. Our goal is to make automation accessible to everyone through collaboration, and app development a huge part of that. 

## Who we're building for
Our target market are the people running [security operation centers](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-security-operations-center-soc). These exist around the world and at the frontlines, stopping bad behavior from malicious actors trying to cause harm. This means they're always on their toes - which in turn means they don't have much time for process and automation. That's where Shuffle comes in. We make it as simple as possible to get their existing platforms up and running, which giving them actionable advice on how to improve their defenses. Cybersecurity isn't a competition.

## Documentation sources
* [App creation with Shuffle](https://shuffler.io/docs/app_creation)
* [Shuffle Architecture](https://shuffler.io/docs/architecture)
* [Shuffle Extensions](https://shuffler.io/docs/extensions)
* [Workflow documentation](https://shuffler.io/docs/workflows)

## Security Categories 
We have defined eight (8) [main categories as per our category framework](https://github.com/frikky/shuffle-docs/blob/master/handbook/engineering/security_category_framework.md), that are necessary to tackle any cybersecurity threat. 

They are as follows:
1. [Communication](https://github.com/frikky/Shuffle-apps/issues/26) 		- Any way to chat; WhatsApp, SMS, Email etc. 
2. [Case Management](https://github.com/frikky/Shuffle-apps/issues/22)	- The central hub for operation teams.
3. [SIEM](https://github.com/frikky/Shuffle-apps/issues/21)							- Search engine for logs in an enterprise. Used to find evil.
4. [Assets](https://github.com/frikky/Shuffle-apps/issues/25) 					- Discover endpoint information. Vulnerabilities, owners, departments etc.
5. [IAM](https://github.com/frikky/Shuffle-apps/issues/86)  						- Access Management. Active Directory, Google Workspaces, Single Sign-on etc.
6. [Intelligence](https://github.com/frikky/Shuffle-apps/issues/24) 		- Typically a vendor explaining what you should be looking for.
7. [Network](https://github.com/frikky/Shuffle-apps/issues/27)					- Anything BETWEEN your connected devices. Firewalls, WAF, Switches, Bluetooth...
8. [Eradication](https://github.com/frikky/Shuffle-apps/issues/23) 			- Control machines directly to eradicate evil. Hard and undefined (EDR & AV)

### Difficulty of creation 
The categories above are sorted as per their perceived difficulty to understand and build for, from easiest to hardest. This doesn't just include the platforms individually, but how they're integrated with other platforms. If you're new to security, we highly encourage starting in range 1-5, but if you want a challenge - move on :)

## Before you start  
We want to make security a more collaborative space, but everyones trying to lock you into their services. We're trying to stop that by using standards that work outside of Shuffle. Apps that are shared are made public through [Security-Openapi](https://github.com/frikky/security-openapis) [Shuffle-Apps (Python)](https://github.com/frikky/shuffle-apps), then searchable with the help of Algolia.com. By making it and sharing using our app creator you will also stop any gatekeeping in the automation industry, as we also allow others to automate in a good way. 

Create a new app with HTTP here: 			[https://shuffler.io/apps](https://shuffler.io/apps)
Learn about Python App Creation here: [https://shuffler.io/docs/app_creation](https://shuffler.io/docs/app_creation)

Last but not least; make sure to document every step as Markdown in a README.md file! This is then added to Shuffle's UI in order to make documentation easily available to our users.

## Basic Process
1. [Find an app of interest in the todo](https://github.com/frikky/Shuffle-apps/projects/1) that hasn't been made yet.
2. Validate: Does it actually exists or not with [shuffler.io](https://shuffler.io/search), [openapi](https://github.com/frikky/security-openapis) or [python](https://github.com/frikky/shuffle-apps)
3. Find: Explore the applicable services' website and get access through either: 
	* Sign up for an account
	* Set it up locally (open source)
	* Ask for a demo (they'll usually send a mail in minutes)
	* Other options (please share)
PS: If you can't get a hold of the product, but have documentation, please build it anyway. It won't be perfect, but it makes it easier to test with customers.
4. Discover: Get access to their API documentation, and search for OpenAPI/Swagger if possible (ALWAYS DO THIS FIRST).
5. Decide: if you should make it with the App Creator or Python. Always use the App Creator when possible. There are certain authentication mechanisms we can't do with Shuffle yet, but which we may have long-term (oAuth2, AWS boto3 timestamps etc.)
6. Creation: This is where we rely on your expertise for ease of use. Remember that we're making this for non-developers, and less mandatory fields is always better. IMPORTANT:
	* Make it simple to use.
	* Add example responses to the API-calls 
	* Add references to original documentation (urls)
	* Write down anything of importance. It may be useful to others.
7. **TEST**: This is an increasingly important step as we get more integrations on our hand. Don't just test it individually, but test it with other apps in a Workflow. Example: try to synchronize data from what you made with a case management system. Or send a webhook to Shuffle which adds data to it. KEEP these use-cases and make them clear - they can be shared as test-examples.
8. Document: Throughout the process, we expect you to document steps. In most cases, we want it in Markdown format. [Here's a very simple example](https://github.com/frikky/security-openapis/blob/master/docs/discord.md) This may seem tedious, but is EXTREMELY important to keep everyone else up to speed with what you do. 
9. Sharing: Congrats, you're done! All your hard work can now be shared with the world, and we're all that tiny bit more secure. Sharing can be done by:
	OpenAPI: Export the app from the GUI, then make a pull request to the [security-openapi](https://github.com/frikky/security-openapis/compare) repository. Add documentation to the ./docs folder with the same name.
	Python: Make a pull request to the [shuffle-apps](https://github.com/frikky/shuffle-apps/compare) repository. 

## What happens next?
Someone from the Shuffle team will validate the app you submitted and accept it. The last part may become possible through https://shuffler.io at some point. This can be read about further in the [testing documentation](https://github.com/frikky/shuffle-docs/blob/master/handbook/engineering/testing.md)

The next steps below further outlines what we do from the app management side. 

## App process manager  
As more people make and share apps, we need a proper process for preparing AND validating them. Below are some things that we want for each app long-term, to make sure we have good references for everything. These tasks are typically done by the person that chooses what apps should be made next. 

### Preparation
* Work with Workflow creators to define what our next actions should be 
* Get access to the individual platforms for us. This means that we need to know where we can get easy access, and where we can't. 
* Move data around in the project on Github to track where how we're doing. Close and open issues as needed (requires project access).
* Create an issue for each of the platforms mentioned in the categories issues
* Have an overarching place where we can track ALL apps. Not excel / sheets. If we can make the [testing](https://github.com/frikky/shuffle-docs/blob/master/handbook/engineering/testing.md) process good enough, this can be done using Shuffle itself. Here's some of the things we want to add to the tracking of each app on Github:
	- The issue related to the app and their parent issue (SIEM > Splunk)
	- URL to their API documentation 
	- URL to the integration we've created (shuffler.io AND on Github)
	- URL to the documentation (shuffler.io AND on Github)
	- Are special access rights required?
	- Answer: does the tool have webhook or queue capabilities?
* Write and learn about each of the 8 tool categories, and their sub categories 
* Rewrite this process as per how we're working now vs. how we have been working

## App Credits
We want YOU to get the credits for what you create and celebrate you. This means you'll be highlighted when the app is published on shuffler.io as well (if you want). This can be down to the granular level of "actions". This will long-term be reflected with your user on Github.

## Learnings
* Always use the latest version of API's 
* Files aren't obvious. Read the documentation here
* What are artifacts? Explain this better (documentation?)
